            <h4>New Skills:</h4>
            I have learned how to use brackets to make a website and link difference pages. I have learned how to add images, videos, text, a navigation bar and how to add and change the different colours of the page and text. I learned how to make layouts and add images and text to them. I am very proud of myself for learning all this because it was not the easiest for me. This understanding on how websites are made will help me understand other websites and how complex they must be. This will all so help me in the future if I need to make or look at the coding for an other website as I will be able to understand.

            <h4>Intelligent failure</h4>I have made some mistakes with spelling and also my code is messy. next time I would try and make sure all my code is in the right spot and that all of my photos are named and put in the right folder from the very start as it will make it a lot easier to find photos. Also, it is hard to find mistakes in my code when it is messy so that would make it a lot easier to fix. Next time I would also be careful when getting the code from another place like w3schools and only copy over the code I need rather than all of it. This will also help keep my code more organized because I will know what everything is doing.
